# Array-Binary-Search

- Write a function called `BinarySearch` which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

- NOTE: The search algorithm used in your function should be a binary search.

## Approach & Efficiency

- My approach was to make a variable to find the middle index.
- Then start the for loop with that variable
- Use `if and else` statements to do a binary-search
